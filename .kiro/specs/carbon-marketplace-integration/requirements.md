# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables a WordPress/Elementor website to function as a meta search engine for carbon offset projects by integrating with multiple vendor APIs (CNaught and Toucan). The system will display real-time carbon project listings, allow users to search and filter projects based on criteria like location and project type, and facilitate affiliate-style purchases by redirecting users to vendor checkout pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to search for carbon offset projects using filters like location and project type, so that I can find projects that match my specific criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the carbon marketplace page THEN the system SHALL display a search interface with filter options for location, project type, and other relevant criteria
2. WHEN a user applies search filters THEN the system SHALL query cached project data and display matching results in real-time
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN each project SHALL show key information including name, location, project type, price per kg, and availability status
4. IF no projects match the search criteria THEN the system SHALL display a "no results found" message with suggestions to modify search parameters

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to view detailed information about a carbon project, so that I can make an informed decision about purchasing offsets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a project from search results THEN the system SHALL display a detailed project page with comprehensive information
2. WHEN the project detail page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display project details including registry information, location, images, SDGs, methodology, and current pricing
3. WHEN project details are shown THEN the system SHALL include a prominent "Purchase" or "Get Quote" button
4. IF project data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest returning to search results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to get real-time pricing for carbon offsets, so that I can understand the cost before proceeding to purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests pricing information THEN the system SHALL call the vendor API to get current pricing per kg
2. WHEN pricing is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the price clearly with currency and per-unit information
3. WHEN a user specifies a quantity THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the total cost
4. IF pricing is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating pricing is temporarily unavailable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to purchase carbon offsets through a secure checkout process, so that I can complete my transaction safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks to purchase THEN the system SHALL create a checkout session with the appropriate vendor API
2. WHEN the checkout session is created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the vendor's hosted checkout page
3. WHEN a purchase is completed THEN the system SHALL receive webhook notifications about the transaction status
4. WHEN a user returns from checkout THEN the system SHALL display appropriate success or failure messaging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want the system to automatically sync project data from multiple vendors, so that visitors always see current availability and pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs scheduled sync operations THEN it SHALL fetch current portfolios and projects from all configured vendor APIs
2. WHEN new project data is received THEN the system SHALL update the local cache with current information
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN project data is older than the configured TTL THEN the system SHALL refresh the data automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want to configure API credentials and settings for different carbon credit vendors, so that I can manage multiple affiliate partnerships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the plugin settings THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for API credentials and endpoints
2. WHEN API credentials are saved THEN the system SHALL validate the credentials by making test API calls
3. WHEN multiple vendors are configured THEN the system SHALL aggregate and display projects from all active vendors
4. IF API credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and prevent saving

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see proof of retirement for completed purchases, so that I can verify the authenticity of my carbon offset purchase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a purchase is completed THEN the system SHALL store order details and retirement information
2. WHEN a user requests proof of retirement THEN the system SHALL display retirement certificates with serial numbers and registry links
3. WHEN retirement data is available THEN the system SHALL show project allocations and retirement records
4. IF retirement proof is not yet available THEN the system SHALL indicate when it will be ready

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a website administrator, I want to track affiliate commissions and conversion metrics, so that I can measure the success of the carbon marketplace integration.

1. WHEN users complete purchases THEN the system SHALL track conversion events and associate them with the originating website
2. WHEN affiliate data is available THEN the system SHALL provide reporting on clicks, conversions, and commission earnings
3. WHEN webhook notifications are received THEN the system SHALL update order status and commission tracking
4. WHEN administrators view reports THEN the system SHALL display metrics by vendor, time period, and project type
